# Studium: The Unified Platform for College Life üéì

> **Studium** is a student-first platform that blends **Notion**'s knowledge sharing, **Reddit**'s community interaction, and **LinkedIn**'s professional networking‚Äîall within a single, secure, college-specific ecosystem.

## Project Vision & Problem Statement

The college experience is currently fragmented and inefficient. Students are forced to rely on a mix of disconnected platforms to manage their academic, social, and professional lives, which leads to several key problems:

- **Isolation in College:** New students often feel lost and struggle to find a supportive network, making it difficult to find peers for help or connect with seniors.
- **Scattered Resources:** Essential academic resources‚Äîlike notes, past papers, and study guides‚Äîare buried in temporary WhatsApp groups or disorganized cloud drives, making them difficult to find and often lost forever.
- **Limited Networking:** Students lack a dedicated, peer-focused platform. LinkedIn is too formal for daily questions, and broad platforms like Reddit are not tailored to a specific campus community.
- **Lack of Trusted Reviews:** It‚Äôs difficult for students to make informed decisions about courses, faculty, and campus events without a centralized source of honest, peer-generated reviews.

**Studium** solves these problems by creating a single, cohesive hub that centralizes all aspects of campus life, empowering students to build community, share knowledge, and seize opportunities.
